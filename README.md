<h1> Problem statement </h1>
<h2>The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of cars based on different attributes. </h2>
We will use the 'cars_price.csv' dataset, which contains information about 206 cars, including their make, model, fuel type, engine size, horsepower, and other features. 
Our aim is to develop a model that can predict car prices with the highest possible accuracy. Linear regression model can be used to predict the price of the cars.
