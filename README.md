Problem statement 
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of cars based on different attributes. We will use the 'cars_price.csv' dataset, which contains information about 206 cars, including their make, model, fuel type, engine size, horsepower, and other features.Â 
Our aim is to develop a model that can predict car prices with the highest possible accuracy. We will be using linear regression model to predict the price of the cars
